#### Description
MUSIN is a project aimed at developing an artificial intelligence system capable of playing the card game Mus at a level comparable to an experienced human player. The program combines advanced statistical analysis with decision-making algorithms to adapt to different scenarios in the game, incorporating elements such as bluffing and real-time probability calculation.

This project explores how artificial intelligence can address strategic challenges in traditional card games, offering a technically advanced solution in the realm of social and recreational games.

#### Features
- Probability calculations for winning hands.
- Strategic adaptation based on the game's state.
- Intuitive graphical interface.
- Advanced algorithms for real-time decision-making.

#### System Requirements
- Programming language: C
- Required tools:
    - C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
    - `make` (optional)
